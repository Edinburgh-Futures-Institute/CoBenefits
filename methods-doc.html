<h2 id="uk-co-benefits-atlas-methodology">UK Co-Benefits Atlas Methodology</h2>
<p>The CCC has outlined necessary low-carbon actions for the UK to reach
net zero in its 7<sup>th</sup> Carbon Budget<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
These national-level measures have been redistributed across localities
based on each area’s specific characteristics like rurality, age,
building types and travel patterns. The subsequent impact of these
interventions have been modelled according to the place-based
methodology of each of the 11 co-benefit types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Air quality improvements</p></li>
<li><p>Noise reduction</p></li>
<li><p>Excess cold reduction</p></li>
<li><p>Excess heat reduction</p></li>
<li><p>Dampness reduction</p></li>
<li><p>Congestion impacts</p></li>
<li><p>Longer travel times</p></li>
<li><p>Road maintenance impacts</p></li>
<li><p>Road safety impacts</p></li>
<li><p>Physical activity increase</p></li>
<li><p>Dietary improvements</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above cobenefit types are modelled against a baseline trajectory for each local area, with the difference between the net-zero and baseline scenarios resulting in the projected co-benefit gains. The co-benefits are modelled and distributed to beneficiaries directly and indirectly, for example to individuals via improved quality of life, or to national bodies like the NHS or the Exchequer in the form of reduced spending requirements.</p>
<p>Similar social impact modelling has previously been developed and utilised<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> by local authorities and actors in compliance with UK Green Book methodologies. This analysis has built on previous projects developed for the CCC and in conjunction with PwC<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> to quantify impacts on health and society from net-zero interventions.</p>
<p>It uses reported data at the highest available resolution (data zones or LSOAs) across the UK to aggregate populations into archetypes based on social and economic characteristics. The interventions are modelled and distributed through these archetype groupings, while accounting for local variation by geographic area (congestion bands, population density, EPC ratings, etc.).</p>
<p>The analysed co-benefits are not exhaustive, and projected estimates are therefore conservative. Due to scoping constraints and data limitations, the 11 co-benefit types were selected as being the most methodologically robust. They cover all central technologies in the CCC’s pathway to reach net-zero<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> in the buildings and transport sector, as well as the impact on human health from shifts to low-carbon, plant-based diets. These interventions include:</p>
<p><strong>Buildings Sector:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hybrid heat pump</p></li>
<li><p>Air source heat pump</p></li>
<li><p>Ground source heat pump</p></li>
<li><p>Floor insulation</p></li>
<li><p>Roof insulation</p></li>
<li><p>Solid wall insulation</p></li>
<li><p>Cavity wall insulation</p></li>
<li><p>Other insulation types</p></li>
<li><p>More efficient appliances</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transport:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduction in transport demand</p></li>
<li><p>Shifts to low-carbon transport (public transport, electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, active travel).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dietary Change:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shifts to healthier diets (reductions in meat and dairy, replaced with plant-based foods)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="air-quality">Air Quality </h3>
<p>The air quality co-benefit measures the reduction in air pollution, primarily as a result of decreased fossil fuel combustion, and quantifies the benefit to individuals and society.</p>
<p>Air quality improvements are quantified by modelling the delta of energy consumption between the low-carbon intervention (e.g. heat pumps) and the counterfactual (e.g. gas boilers), before estimating the tonnes of pollutants mitigated by type. The reduction in pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>) from fossil fuel combustion are valued according to UK Green Book valuations (developed by Ricardo<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>).</p>
<p>These avoided damages are allocated according to beneficiary type (health/non-health, productivity, etc.), and distributed to households indirectly according to population density bands. The sum of air quality co-benefits from the buildings and transport sectors represent the total air quality co-benefit estimations.</p>
<p>These benefits are discounted according to HM Treasury’s Green Book appraisal guidance for social (1.5% p.a.) and central discount rates (3.5%)<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Buildings – We first calculate the baseline emissions of damaging pollutants by multiplying the deployment of the counterfactual by fuel type (e.g. gas boilers, combi boilers, oil boilers (according to EPC data of the local area)) by energy usage per unit. We multiply the energy usage in kwh/mwh by factors developed by Ricardo<sup>1</sup> according to fuel type to calculate tonnes of emitted pollutant. These estimates are multiplied by damage costs<sup>1</sup> to calculate the total valuation of mitigated air pollution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These avoided damages cover economic, social and environmental degradation, and are distributed to inhabitants specific to the area in question (improvements in life expectancy, improved health outcomes, etc.), or nationally where appropriate (NHS savings, productivity gains, etc.). Due to constraints in the literature, changes to indoor air quality were not modelled in this analysis.</p>
<p>The avoided damages (i.e. benefits) are measured annually, accounting for forecasted changes in population growth, fuel usages, and emissions intensities. All costs are discounted through to 2050.</p>

<p>Transport <em><strong>–</strong></em> We model the baseline scenario for vehicles driven in a given area, based on per capita assumptions from national and regional travel patterns, estimating travel by vehicle type, road type, and fuel type<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. This is multiplied by average fuel consumption by vehicle type and per kilometre travelled, which is then multiplied by air pollutant emissions factors to estimate total emitted pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>) from travel in an area from tailpipe emissions. Non-exhaust emissions (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) from wear on tyres, brakes and roads are estimated from distance travelled, using emissions factors from the Air Quality Expert Group<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Damage factors are applied on a per-tonne of pollutant basis, according to pollutant type and rurality bands.</p>

<h3 id="excess-cold">Excess Cold</h3>
<p>Excess cold co-benefit represents the avoided costs of poor health and NHS costs resulting from individuals living in homes with low internal temperatures.</p>
<p>A building physics model is used to estimate internal temperature before and after installation of the low-carbon intervention, based on the household’s physical properties and characteristics. Buildings with temperatures below the excess cold threshold (19<sup>ο</sup> Celsius) are then mapped to damage costs developed by BRE<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> to estimate improvements in health, quality of life, and NHS savings, with seasonal variations in temperature accounted for.</p>
<p>Damages are more heavily-weighted at the lower end of the temperature spectrum, using a sigmoid function from 10<sup>ο</sup> – 19<sup>ο</sup> Celsius. This allows us to properly quantify the reduction in excess cold damages if a property’s temperature increases from 12<sup>ο</sup> - 18<sup>ο</sup> Celsius; i.e. the most severe health outcomes originate from the lowest-temperature households. All households over 19<sup>ο</sup> Celsius are by definition not at risk of excess cold.</p>
<p>Quality of life and health improvements are distributed directly to the household implementing the low-carbon measure, with economy and NHS savings attributed indirectly to society.</p>

<h3 id="dampness">Dampness</h3>
<p>The reduction in dampness is a co-benefit resulting from decreased excess humidity in buildings, which leads to lower incidence of mould, building damage, and microbial growth; all of which can result in health deficiencies.</p>
<p>The co-benefit is quantified in a similar manner to excess cold, using the building physics model to map relative humidity to internal temperature<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, comparing the baseline humidity to the humidity levels after the intervention, and measuring the corresponding reduction in health risk<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The co-benefits are distributed directly to the proponent of the low-carbon action as health benefits, with indirect impacts appropriated across relevant households and to the NHS.</p>

<h3 id="noise">Noise</h3>
<p>The reduction of noise co-benefit is a result of decreased levels of noise pollution, which lead to the negative effects on the health and well-being of society and ecosystems.</p>
<p>Environmental noise pollution is the second-greatest environmental risk in Europe<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, leading to declines in quality of life, reduced amenity, sleep disturbances, and increased health risks.</p>
<p>The co-benefit is quantified by estimating baseline noise in the local area, through mapping noise levels by road type and rural-urban classification, using estimates from the Department for Transport<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The change in noise pollution is modelled by using the relationship between vehicle type and noise<sup>11</sup>, to estimate the marginal changes in decibels per vehicular kilometre travelled (either by reduction in vkmt or shifting vkmt to EVs). The benefits are valued using the DfT’s TAG noise assessment databook<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, and distributed to populations based on the rural-urban classification in which the reduction in noise occurs, so that avoided damages can be weighted appropriately. This is broken down into distinct damage pathways, like increased amenity and reduced sleep disturbance.</p>

<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical Activity</h3>
<p>Increased physical activity co-benefit represents the health benefits
gained through increased levels of exercise, resulting from a shift to
active travel journeys from car trips.</p>
<p>Physical inactivity is associated with 1in 6 deaths in the UK and
costs £7.4 billion each year<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>. Physical activity
levels vary by population subsets, with men, higher earners and younger
age groups more likely to be physical active.<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Shifts away from carbon-intensive journeys form an important part of
the UK’s journey to net-zero, with varying shifts to active travel
journeys projected across the UK. The increased levels of exercise,
relative to baseline activity levels, will result in health improvements
from the reduced risk of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular
disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Shifts from the CCC’s Seventh Carbon Budget are reallocated across
the UK according to rurality bands and current travel patterns, with the
greater shifts occurring in urban areas in line with CCC guidance and
current travel patterns disaggregated by rurality and road types by the
National Travel Survey (NTS)<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. Total UK-level shifts
by mode were reallocated on a per-capita basis based on these

age and sex, it is also used to predict increases in life expectancy,
qualified through the UK Green Book’s Value of a Life Year (VOLY), and
discounted according to health discount rates in the guidance (1.5%).
Benefits are allocated directly to the individuals undertaking the

<h3 id="congestion">Congestion</h3>
<p>Congestion occurs when demand for road usage exceeds capacity,
characterised by decreased vehicular speeds and therefore longer journey
times.</p>
<p>Low-carbon interventions, such as switches to active travel, buses
and reduced demand for driving can result in greater time available to
individuals to spend on work or leisure. Conversely, low-carbon
interventions can also increase road usage, such as switches to EVs, due
to ‘comfort-taking’ or ‘rebound effects,’ as a result of cheaper journey
costs<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>

<h2 id="road-repairs">Road Repairs</h2>
<p>The road repairs co-benefit type estimates the impact of projected
changes in road usage on road maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Projected low-carbon actions in the transport sector will have an
impact on current road maintenance requirements. Certain actions, like
switches to EVs (which are heavier than ICE vehicles) can result in
increased requirements for road repairs. Demand-reduction activities
like switches to active travel result in reduced necessity for road
maintenance. The projected impacts vary widely across road types,
vehicle types and rurality classifications, and factors like vehicular
speeds.</p>
<p>We model the baseline scenario for vehicles driven in a given area,
based on per capita assumptions from national and regional travel
patterns, estimating travel by vehicle type, road type, and fuel type<a
href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>. Applying the CCC’s projections for
modal shifts, vehicle type usage and subsequent rebound effects to
current travel patterns disaggregated by regions, ruralities and
archetypes, we can model difference in road usage across the baseline
and net-zero scenario.</p>
<p>The resultant net impacts of changes to required road maintenance are
measured using the DfT’s MEC valuations from the WebTAG databook, which
provide valuations for avoided infrastructure damages. These valuations
are multiplied by the kilometres travelled across the scenarios, which
are disaggregated by road type, vehicle type and rurality band. The
difference across scenarios provides the net impact on road repairs from
increased or decreased travel per local area.</p>

<h3 id="excess-heat">Excess Heat</h3>
<p>Excess heat co-benefit represents the avoided costs of poor health
and NHS costs resulting from individuals living in homes with
dangerously high internal temperatures.</p>
<p>A building physics model is used to estimate internal temperature
before and after installation of the low-carbon intervention, based on
the household’s physical properties and characteristics. Buildings with
temperatures above the excess heat threshold (21<sup>ο</sup> Celsius)
are then mapped to damage costs developed by BRE<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a><a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> to estimate improvements in health,
quality of life, and NHS savings, with seasonal variations in
temperature accounted for.</p>
<p>Damages are more heavily weighted at the higher end of the
temperature spectrum, using a sigmoidal function (i.e. the most severe
health outcomes originate from the highest-temperature households). The
savings are also adjusted based on the likelihood of vulnerable
occupants within each household, using Frontier Economics Distributional
Model<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Quality of life and health improvements are distributed directly to
the household implementing the low-carbon measure, with economy and NHS
savings attributed indirectly to society.</p>

<p>Dietary change co-benefit models the impact on health from
individuals shifting from meat and dairy consumption to more plant-based
diets.</p>
<p>Shifts away from carbon-intensive food types, namely meat and dairy
products, to plant-based foods are associated with carbon reductions as
well as lower incidence of disease<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref"

<p>The resulting change in life expectancy, varying by age and sex
groupings<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
